# 📝 WHAT IT DOES:

- Ship Landing "Intro" like music. 🤩
- More Dropship music. 🤑
- More Ship Eject (fired) Music. 😭
- AND MUCH MORE!

⚠ LIST IS NOT FULLY UPDATED! DOWNLOAD THE MOD AND ENJOY DISCOVERING NEW SOUNDS EVERY PLAYTHROUGH!
note: as i'm working on other projects while still maintaining this mod, I will not be focusing on updating this list, this mod adds over 200+ custom sounds, and more is on the way, so focusing on updating this list constantly would be a big drain of time for me.
